0.  I use git bash as terminal in VSCode, but if other terminals work then ok

1. Clone the repo to work locally:
git clone https://github.com/thaotran27/AppStore.git

2. Check which branch you are on:
git checkout 

(should give sth like your branch is up to date with '...'

3. (if needed) create other branch:
git branch <new_branch_name> 
(change the thing inside <>)

4. (if needed) switch to other branch:
git checkout <branch_name> 

5. push code onto Github remote so everyone can see:
git add .
git commit -m "message_change_this"
git push

if they got error like this: The current branch new_branch has no upstream branch.
git push --set-upstream origin new_branch

then git add, commit and push again
